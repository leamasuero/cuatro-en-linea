# Connect four

[Connect Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. Connect Four is a strongly solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

This was an exercise to see if I can develop this classic game in **5 hours**.

It was not needed to be fancy and it wasn't expected to be perfect code. The idea was to test myself developing the application with limited amount of time.

Aside from coding the app, it was needed to deploy it to heroku.com: [Cuatro en linea](https://cuatro-en-linea.herokuapp.com/)
